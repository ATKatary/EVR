# Video Super Resolution Enhancement
## Abstract
The problem of video super resolution has been long studied over the decades. From single image super resolution models such as the SRCNN to real time rendering models such as NSRR and EGVSR. In this paper we investigate the architectures of some these models, modify and generalize them to OVSRCNN and OVSR. We will show that our modified models preform adequately given the limited resources we had and at times out perform their traditional counter parts. Our main results will include the introduction of a motion compensation pipeline on-top of the NSRR architecture and modifying the SRCNN model to handle video feed and improving resolution through a novel pipeline setup.
